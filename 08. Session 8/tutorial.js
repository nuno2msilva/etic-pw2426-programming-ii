    Exercise: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

    Given items with weights and values, maximize the value in a knapsack of capacity W.

Sample Input:

const items = [  
  { weight: 2, value: 10 },  
  { weight: 3, value: 15 },  
  { weight: 5, value: 40 }  
];  
const capacity = 7;  

Expected Output: 50 (Items 0 and 2 -> 10 + 40 = 50 with total weight 7.

Requirements:

    Use memoization or a DP table.
    Handle up to 1000 items (optimize for time).
